Virtual Labs on Software Defined Networking (SDN)

This lab series provides a detailed, hands-on experience to the new emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN). The manual provides a thorough understanding for administering SDN networks using ONOS controller, demonstrating the available applications supported by ONOS, as well as leveraging their full capabilities.
